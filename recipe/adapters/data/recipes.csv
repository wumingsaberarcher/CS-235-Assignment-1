76,Alfredo Sauce,1535,Marg CaymanDesigns,10,5,15,15th Sep 2015,"This is my son's favorite meal. I make it with shrimp for him for his birthday every year. GREAT for company because it is so easy and yet taste wonderful! I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!)
PLEASE NOTE! This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it!

749,Zucchini Lasagna (Lasagne) - Low Carb,1535,Marg CaymanDesigns,40,20,60,14th Sep 2010,"Great for anyone going low carb OR who has so many zucchini, they don't know what to do!! :) We found the sauce to be very mild. I think it would be better with twice as much garlic. I boiled my zucchini slices for about 3 minutes so they were partially cooked. I wanted to make sure they were soft in the finished dish or I knew the kids wouldn't eat them. ;) The cottage cheese provides a slightly tangy note. I think we would have preferred ricotta, but that is personal taste. I use my 11x7 baking dish and got 6 pieces the size of what you see in my photos. Both of the guys ate two so it fed 4 of us, and I double the meat.

Chili, to an aficionado, is more than a spicy stew; it is a  craving, a passion, for a simmered combination of meat and chile peppers  that warms the heart and inspires the soul.    The exact origin of chili is still shrouded in mystery. Some people believe it  wa  s originated by chuckwagon cooks who regularly prepared stew for the cowpokes  of the Southwest. Possibly, one of the these cooks ran out of black pepper and  in his search for a substitute, he came across some red chile peppers which were  common among the Indians and Mexicans in the territory that is now west Texas.  These undomesticated capsicums were extremely hot. When the cowboys inquired  about the source of the extreme heat, they were told that the heat came from the  &quot;chile&quot;, or hot pepper. Over time, this sizzling stew became popular in its own  right, and became known as &quot;chili&quot;.","['https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/78/picrvkOJB.jpg', 'https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/78/pic8N2kt5.jpg', 'https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/78/picr9DOvn.jpg']",Southwestern U.S.,"['2', '2', '1', '1', '1', '2', '1', '1 1/2', '6 -7', '1/4', '1', '1/2', '1/2', '1', '2']","['lean ground beef', 'onions', 'green pepper', 'celery', 'garlic clove', 'tomatoes', 'tomato sauce', 'water', 'chili powder', 'salt', 'black pepper', 'bay leaf', 'red kidney beans']",3198,104,38.9,589.7,6862.9,304.1,101.9,63.2,278.5,NA,1 pot,"['Cook ground beef, onions, green pepper, celer y, and garlic in large pan till  meat is browned.', 'Do not drain.', 'Stir in undrained tomatoes, and remaining  ingredients except kidney beans.', 'Simmer uncovered for 1 1/2 hrs., stirring  occasionally.', 'Stir in beans and cook another 30 minutes.']"
